# TODO:
# 1. Add in-house NHANES estimate. Specifically, we could present NHANES data
# for HBV-core antibody (evidence of past infection), and HBV-surface antigen
# (evidence of active acute or chronic infection):
# https://wwwn.cdc.gov/Nchs/Nhanes/2017-2018/HEPBD_J.htm
# 2. Incorporate an estimate based on mortality date. This data can be acquired
# from the CDC WONDER database (https://wonder.cdc.gov/mcd-icd10-provisional.html).
# Parameters for relevant query is:
# - Select time period of death": 2022, and
# - Select underlying cause of death: B16 (Acute hepatitis B).
# All other fields can be left as default.
