# "The first day of any MMWR week is Sunday. MMWR week numbering is
#  sequential beginning with 1 and incrementing with each week to a
#  maximum of 52 or 53. MMWR week #1 of an MMWR year is the first week
#  of the year that has at least four days in the calendar year. For
#  example, if January 1 occurs on a Sunday, Monday, Tuesday or
#  Wednesday, the calendar week that includes January 1 would be MMWR
#  week #1. If January 1 occurs on a Thursday, Friday, or Saturday, the
#  calendar week that includes January 1 would be the last MMWR week of
#  the previous year (#52 or #53). Because of this rule, December 29,
#  30, and 31 could potentially fall into MMWR week #1 of the following
#  MMWR year."
# Another way of saying this is that in years where Jan 1 falls on Thursday,
# Friday, Saturday, or Sunday then the first MMWR week of the year starts on
# the first Sunday of the year, while if it falls on Monday, Tuesday, or
# Wednesday then the first week starts with the last Sunday of the previous
