background = """EBV stands for Epstein-Barr virus. It is a type of 
herpes virus that infects humans and is known to cause infectious 
mononucleosis, also known as mono or glandular fever. 
EBV is a common virus that is transmitted through contact with infected
saliva, such as through kissing, sharing utensils, or close contact with
an infected person's respiratory droplets. EBV is a widespread virus that 
can persist in the body for life, although most people infected with EBV 
do not develop symptoms or have mild symptoms that resemble the flu."""

# TODO: Simon will look into incidence of mononucleosis in the US. There is
# also the question of mono being a proxy for EBV infection, or activation.
