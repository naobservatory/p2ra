## Prevalence Data | Prevalence to Relative Abundance Project


This repository contains Python scripts and data to compute prevalence
estimates for various pathogens, starting with Herpes Simplex Virus 1
(HSV-1). In the future, the repository will be expanded to include prevalence
estimates for more pathogens beyond HSV-1. The ultimate goal of the project is
to provide prevalence data for many different pathogens, which can then be
linked to respective relative abundance data.

Files
 - `pathogens/hsv_1.py`: Contains background information, pathogen
   characteristics, and prevalence variables for Herpes Simplex Virus 1
   (HSV-1).
 - `pathogen_properties.py`: Defines data structures for representing pathogen
   characteristics and prevalence variables.
 - `test.py`: Unit tests

### Testing

Run `./test.py`
